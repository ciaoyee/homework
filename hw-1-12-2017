Absolute v. Relative Paths
The commands 5, 7, 8, & 9 are useable to navigate to Amanda's home directory /Users/amanda from /Users/amanda/data.
5. cd ~ 
	possible b/c the ~ represents the user's home directory (which would be /Users/amanda) so 
	it would go straight to there
7. cd ~/data/..
	possible b/c it has the ~ and also indicates that we want to go back from /data
	*complicated*
8. cd
	possible b/c it's the shortcut to go to the user's home directory
9. cd ..
	possible b/c it goes back one level (like from /Users/amanda/data to /Users/amanda)

The commands 1, 2, 3, 4, & 6 would not work.
1. cd .
	not possible b/c . stands for current directory
2. cd /
	/ stands for root directory
3. cd /home/amanda
	Amanda's home directory is /Users/amanda not /home/amanda
4. cd ../..
	goes back TWO levels 
6. cd home
	would end up bringing us to a directory home in the current directory (if it exists there)
